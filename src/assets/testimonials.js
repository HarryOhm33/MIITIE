    extendedQuote: `As the founder of Sarva Suvidhane Pvt Ltd (S2), I wholeheartedly extend my deepest gratitude to MIITTIE at Darbhanga College of Engineering. Their unwavering support has been one of the most significant pillars in our entrepreneurial journey. 
  
  What started as a vision to solve local problems and bring regional flavors to a wider audience has now transformed into a growing enterprise—thanks in large part to their mentorship and resources.
  
  MIITTIE provided us with not just technical guidance, but also strategic insights, networking opportunities, and access to an ecosystem that truly nurtures innovation. Their belief in our potential gave us the confidence to push boundaries and expand our solutions across five zones of Indian Railways—ECR, ER, NFR, NR, and NCR.
  
  Today, our services have reached over 500 trains and 90 railway stations, a milestone that reflects the strength of our partnership and shared vision. Their ecosystem fostered a sense of belief and direction that helped us stay focused on our mission.
  
  With their continued backing, we are proudly working towards taking the authentic taste of Bihar to dinner tables across the country—creating not just business growth, but also opportunities for local farmers, food artisans, and supply chain workers.
  
  MIITTIE has not just helped us grow—they’ve helped us dream bigger and act bolder. For that, I remain sincerely thankful. It’s collaborations like these that truly ignite the spirit of local entrepreneurship and turn ideas into impactful realities.`,

    extendedQuote: `As healthcare professionals trying to build a tech solution, we faced skepticism from both the medical and tech communities. MIITIE provided the perfect neutral ground where both sides could collaborate.

The center's partnerships with local hospitals gave us access to real clinical environments where we could test our patient management system. The monthly demo days forced us to continually improve our product based on direct feedback from doctors and nurses.

Through MIITIE's corporate partnership program, we connected with a major EHR provider that eventually became our first enterprise client. The legal assistance we received helped us navigate complex healthcare regulations and data privacy requirements.

Two years later, our system is used in 17 clinics across North India, reducing patient wait times by 40% and improving record accuracy. We still participate in MIITIE's mentorship program, now as advisors to new healthcare startups.`,

    extendedQuote: `As a woman-led environmental startup, we initially struggled to be taken seriously in the waste management sector. MIITIE's Women Entrepreneurship Initiative provided targeted support, including access to female investors and industry leaders.

The center's lab facilities allowed us to develop and test our plastic recycling process at small scale before seeking manufacturing partners. The business model workshops helped us identify the most sustainable revenue streams.

MIITIE's brand association opened doors with municipal corporations that would have otherwise been closed to a young startup. Our first city contract came directly through a connection made at a MIITIE networking event.

Today, we process over 5 tons of plastic waste daily, employing 45 women from underserved communities. We've expanded to three cities and are in talks to license our technology to other states. The confidence and skills we gained at MIITIE continue to drive our growth.`,
